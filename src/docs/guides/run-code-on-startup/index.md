# How to run tasks on application startup from a module

You can add a class that implements `IModularTenantEvents` and use the 
`ActivatedAsync()` or `ActivatingAsync()` handlers.

The events are raised per tenant.
One thing to take into account is that tenants are lazy loaded, so when the app
starts the event handlers are not called but instead are called when the first 
request arrives for each specific tenant.

An example implementation:

```csharp

public class MyStartupTaskService : IModularTenantEvents
{
    private readonly ILogger<TempDirCleanerService> _logger;

    public TempDirCleanerService(ILogger<TempDirCleanerService> logger)
    {
        _logger = logger;
    }

    public async Task ActivatedAsync()
    {
        _logger.LogInfo("logging tenant activation.");
    }

    public Task ActivatingAsync()
    {
        return Task.CompletedTask;
    }

    public Task TerminatedAsync()
    {
        return Task.CompletedTask;
    }

    public Task TerminatingAsync()
    {
        return Task.CompletedTask;
    }
}
```

Then you have to register your service on `ConfigureServices()` method of the module's Startup.cs file:

```csharp
services.AddScoped<IModularTenantEvents, MyStartupTaskService>();
```
